            <h1 class="history-title">History</h1>
            <p class="history-content-1">On May 1st, 1886, labour unions in the United States initiated a strike
                advocating for an eight-hour workday,
                a pivotal moment in labour history. The strike culminated in the tragic events of May 4th, 1886, at
                Chicago’s Haymarket Square, where a peaceful rally turned violent with a bomb explosion, resulting in
                casualties among both civilians and police officers.</p>
            <p class="history-content-2">
                Following a meeting in Paris in 1889, the decision to commemorate May Day annually was made, inspired by
                the
                Chicago protests. Raymond Lavigne’s proposal for international demonstrations to mark the anniversary of
                the
                Haymarket events laid the foundation for the official recognition of May Day as an annual event by the
                International’s 2nd Congress in 1891.

                In India, on May 1st, 1923, where the first May Day celebrations were organised in Chennai by the Labour
                Kisan Party of Hindustan, led by Comrade Singaravelar, who arranged two significant meetings to honour
                this
                occasion.

                <li class="significance-content">Labour Day is celebrated with various events and festivities across the globe. From parades and
                    marches to speeches and cultural performances, these celebrations serve to honour the contributions

                    In many countries, Labour Day is observed as a national public holiday, allowing workers to take a
                    well-deserved break and reflect on the progress made in securing their rights and improving their
                    working conditions.

                <li class="significance-content-1">
                    This annual observance is a powerful reminder of the ongoing struggle for social justice and the
                    crucial role that workers play in the fabric of our societies.

                    By recognising the hard work and sacrifices of the labour force, we can collectively work towards a
                    future where decent work and social justice are the cornerstones of a thriving global economy.
